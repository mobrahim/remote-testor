These are the JAR files as found in the official Groovy distribution.

The following renames had to be done so that the ant launcher script works:
  ant-1.7.0.jar -> ant.jar
  ant-junit-1.7.0.jar -> ant-junit.jar
  ant-launcher-1.7.0.jar -> ant-launcher.jar
  antlr-2.7.6.jar -> ant-antlr.jar

There are some additional 3rd-party JAR files in here as well.
